# Cat App

![app-image](image.png)

It's an app with a bunch of cats! But it can teach you how to use the Remix framework.

## Development

From the terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts the app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build the app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```
